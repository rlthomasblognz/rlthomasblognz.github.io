<h1>Readme</h1>

This Github Repo is literally just for me to host my little blog full of my stupid endeavours. The code is really basic, shitty HTML and CSS with some messy JavaScript thrown in for good measure. It shouldn't be too complex, and I try my best to have good and tidy code but that ain't gonna happen. Please just leave this alone, none of it is special or professional in any way.

Cheers,
