<center><h3>Random Thoughts</h3></center>
<ul id="ThoughtList">
<li>Web and Text-Based Dev is hard and boring, and it always goes wrong.</li>
<li>Tailoring is fun - once you figure out math, the math is the hard part.</li>
<li>Typewriters are very satisfying to use. All they do is go "thunk", "thwack", and "PING!".</li>
<li>Github using CLI and Linux is confusing af for a beginner, especially when the GithubPages guide doesn't mention tokens or anything.</li>
</ul>

<center><h3>Welcome!</h3></center>
<p>So I decided to do this, and therefore do this I shall. This blog is going to contain pretty much every creative thing I make or do, be it game dev or model railways. Hopefully it serves as a form of motivation, and gives me an excuse to write. I am thinking of maybe streaming game dev and anything digital on twitch once I get half-decent internet. Hell I might not even get this online. We'll see. Anyway, have a gander through the pages over on the left of the screen. Hope you find all this at least somewhat interesting!</p>
