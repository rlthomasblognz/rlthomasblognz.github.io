    <center><h3>Random Thoughts</h3></center>
    <ul id="ThoughtList">
      <li>Web and Text-Based Dev is hard and boring, and it always goes wrong.</li>
      <li>Tailoring is fun - once you figure out math, the math is the hard part.</li>
      <li>Typewriters are very satisfying to use. All they do is go "thunk", "thwack", and "PING!".</li>
      <li>Github using CLI and Linux is confusing af for a beginner, especially when the GithubPages guide doesn't mention tokens or anything.</li>

    <p>Hi! My name is Ryan, and I am a 19 year old Male New Zealander who is doing things on the internet. I have ADHD and ASD, as well as several other things so a lot of the time I struggle to do things regularly. I will forget to update this blog. It is just for me to put my shtuff so I can maybe have motivation so not that important. I am trying to start my own tailoring company, and my dream is to have my own tailorshop here in NZ. I don't really do much more, but I am attempting to learn HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript through making a couple of Twine/Sugarcube games. Anything I make and put online (like my games) will be free, and eventually I will set up a Patreon or Kofi or something. There are a couple other games I'm making but they are secrit lol. No you won't know about them cause I ain't tellin. Anyhoooo, enjoy looking at my utter bollocks and if you like it I'm doing something right.</p>
